# Nanopore-RRN-Sequncing 
Pipeline and Methods for 16S-ITS-23S rRNA Nanopore Sequencing with Custom Barcodes \


# Amplification Conditions
The construct of these RRN primers are for both the forward and reverse (5' - 3'): \
'Linker' -- '16-mer barcode' -- 'primer' \

The linker sequence is : \
"GATC"

The primer binding sequences used were : \
Forward 16S (5'-3') : AGRRTTYGATYHTDGYTYAG \
Reverse 23S (5'-3') : CCRAMCTGTCTCACGACG \

The final primer sequences used \
